# N8finch WP Gatsby Starter

Working out my own custom Gatsby theme for my site.

## The ToDo List

- ✅ posts queried and displayed
- ✅ pages queried and displayed
- ✅ categories and tags queried and displayed
- ___ implement light/dark mode
- arrange and style like tania.dev and adamwathan.me


## Stretch Goals

- ___ Featured images done with Gatsby Image
- ___ internal links are replaced with Gatsby `Link` (`gatsby-plugin-catch-links` doesn't seem to work?)
