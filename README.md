# N8finch WP Gatsby Starter

Working out my own custom Gatsby theme for my site.

## The ToDo List

- ✅ posts queried and displayed
- ✅ pages queried and displayed
- ✅ categories and tags queried and displayed
- ___ get the Primary menu (by slug: `primary`)
- ✅ implement light/dark mode, from [Using React Context API with Gatsby by Muhammad Muhsin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-01-31-using-react-context-api-with-gatsby/)
- arrange and style like tania.dev and adamwathan.me


## Stretch Goals

- ___ Featured images done with Gatsby Image
- ___ internal links are replaced with Gatsby `Link` (`gatsby-plugin-catch-links` doesn't seem to work?)
